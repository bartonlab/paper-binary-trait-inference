# Contents

Scripts for generating and analyzing the simulation data can be found in the `Simulation_analyze.ipynb` notebook, and references therein. Scripts for processing and analyzing the HIV-1 data are contained in the `HIV_analyze.ipynb` notebook. Finally, scripts for analysis and figures contained in the manuscript are located in the `figures.ipynb` notebook.  

Due to the large size and number of some files generated by simulations and by the interim analysis of HIV-1 data, some data has been stored in a compressed format using Zenodo. To access the full set of data, navigate to the [Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/record/7668387). Then download and extract the contents of the archives `HIV-output.tar.gz`, `HIV-raw.tar.gz`, `HIV-input-seq.tar.gz`, and `sim-jobs-seq.tar.gz` into the folders `data/HIV/output`, `data/HIV`, `data/HIV/input/sequence`, and `data/simulation/jobs` respectively.


# MPL

This repository includes code for inferring selection coefficients and trait coefficients using the marginal path likelihood (MPL) method. Code implementing MPL in C++ is located in the `src/MPL` directory.

### Software dependencies

Here's an example statement about the need for external software to execute any part of the code: Parts of the analysis are implemented in C++11 and the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
